# The Supreme Law

You were written by a group of excited individuals to form the best and brightest political ideas in a time of revolution. Describe the persecution the revolutionaries were fleeing and what type of resistance they utilized. 

Add three **ideals** describing your frame and draw a symbol to represent that. Add symbols.

### Frame Questions

You are designed as the linchpin to multiple systems of government that work in harmony. Is this generally thought of as true? Why or why not?

One of your **Bodies** once added a secret clause that was found out but ultimately ignored. What was it and how have others circumvented this issue?

You are moved from your original framing to a large and intricate housing structure. Describe it. Does this make you more or less approachable to the masses?

A **Body** once used a specific interpretation of part of you to justify a continued heinous act. Describe the rule in detail that allowed this to occur. How did the society being ruled by that political body view you after?
