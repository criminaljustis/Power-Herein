# Ending the Game

Once you have finished the third act, the game is over. Once the final **Body** is resolved, the **Frame** of government is dismantled, lost, buried in a musuem, or forgotten forever.

When the game is completed, it is recommended to stop and think think. Sit in silence and dwell on the way power is utilized by individuals to govern the larger body. Think on the way your local power structures work and how you can positively influence them.
