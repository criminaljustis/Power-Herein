# Game Structure

## Acts

An Act is a collection of **Bodies** and **Rests** with a connecting theme. You will play through three Acts over the course of the game, choosing a fixed number of **Bodies** from an Act, resolving the prompts, and moving on.

### Resolving an Body

After selecting a **Body**, you will complete a series of prompts to tell their story and explore the existence and development of the **Frame**. You can use these prompts to tell a detailed story, or summarize the existence of your **Frame**.  


Please complete the following steps to resolve a **Body**:

1. Choose a **Body** from those available in the current Act.
2. Describe the **Body**, providing a name \(if appropriate\) and a few details.
3. Consider how they came to power over the **Frame**.
4. Answer the two **Body** questions.
5. Choose a prompt from either Power & Prosperity or Necessary & Negligent to define the **Body**'s time with the **Frame**.
6. Optionally answer one of the **Frame** questions in the Playbook.
7. Consider how the **Body** loses or relinquishes power over the **Frame**.

You are also encouraged to write a few lines describing these events.

### Resolving a Rest

After resolving a **Body**, players complete the following steps to resolve a **Rest**:

1. Choose how much time to **Rest** from those available in the current Act.
2. Wait in silence, or with music, for the assigned time.
3. Choose prompt\(s\) from either Changes & Events or Burnt & Frayed to show the effects of time passing.
4. If players have met the requirement to move on to a new Act \(such as having resolved two **Bodies** from the current Act\), do so.
5. Then, begin either select a new **Body** or move on to the next Act, as appropriate.

### Breaks

At this point stop to think about taking a break. If you write a lot of detail of a **Body**, it may be best to play over several sessions instead of one long marathon.
