# Game Concepts

## A Frame of Government

With the game Power Herein, you will explore a society's relationship with their government by playing as a **Frame** of government ****or, a Political Document or Institution. This **Frame** will change, grow, inspire, create or destroy power structures, and be a beacon of order as you play. A **Frame** of Government cannot die but can be tarnished, lost, rewritten, forgotten, or purposefully ignored.

Currently there is only one playbook. Others may follow and this will be revised as necessary.

## The Body

A **Frame** is subject to the Political **Body** acting on it at the time. The agency of the **Frame** is limited by what power structure is currently in place and acting on it. You will be writing the details of each **Body** and how they came to power, how they treat the **Frame** of government, what they achieve with it, and how it changes them. 

## Time & Rest

A Political **Body** can change via the will of the people, a military coup, the return of a dictator, or other means. In this game, the **Body** will change over to a new one. When this happens, turmoil, peace, or other means will prevent changes to the **Frame** as the daily lives of the people continue. When this happens, you are at **Rest**. You always determine how much **Time** passes while you wait. Eventually, a new **Body** will rise and govern the people.

## Ideals

**Ideals** are characteristics that describe your **Frame** of government. They may be physical, political, or personal ideals. Each **Frame** has it's own set of **Ideals** for that type but feel free to invent or utilize your own as you wish. The precise definition of each **Ideal** is not important and can mean whatever you wish. 

## Change

While playing Power Herein, the **Frame** will change and evolve, adjusted by its use, **Time** passing, and the **Bodies** who use it. At various points you will be asked to **Change Something** about the **Frame** of government. This means adding, removing or modifying:

* an **Ideal** 
* A detail about something in your world - A name, Faction, Power Structure, etc. 
* A response to one of your **Frame** questions. 
* a detail about the physical housing of your **Frame** 

A large change may make it necessary to do several of these things at once. You can also **Change Something** any time it feels appropriate.
